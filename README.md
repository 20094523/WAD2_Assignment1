## Overview.

This repository contains an extended version of the movies app created in the labs. 
I have added a latest, watchlist and trending pages along with parametized endpoints
for each with their own seperate details.

+ All lab work complete e.g. production countries showing up, adding to watchlist working.
+ Actors added to moviesinfo.
+ Got recommended movies working. First parameterised endpoint.
+ etc

## Setup requirements.

No additional set-up steps necessary. Clone repo onto machine, add your TMDB api key to .env, npm install and npm run.

## API endpoints.
